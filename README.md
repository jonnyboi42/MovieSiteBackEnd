# Movie Site Backend

## Overview
This repository contains the backend for the Movie Site application. It serves as the API that handles data retrieval and serves movie information to the frontend.

## Current Configuration
- **Port**: The backend is currently set to run on **port 3000** by default.

## Upcoming Changes
In an upcoming update, users will be able to configure the port on which the backend runs. This will allow for more flexibility in different development and production environments.

## Getting Started
To run the backend locally:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/MovieSiteBackEnd.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd MovieSiteBackEnd
   ```

3. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Start the server:
   ```bash
   npm start dev
   ```

The server should now be running on **http://localhost:3000**.

## Configuration
Until the port customization feature is released, the port is hardcoded to 3000. In the future, you will be able to set a custom port via environment variables or a configuration file.
